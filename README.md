# WoxWiki

A note taking personal wiki solution to capture my life.

After getting fedup from a myriad of tools which didn't satisfy
my thirst to *effectively*, *correctly*, and *seemlessly*
capture my thoughts onto the digital media, I finally decided
to write my own solution. This is how **WoxWiki** was born.

But since I'll be using this for life, it's important that my
data is stored in something portable. Flat-files although being
portable, are largely a pain because they don't have a
structured format (and XML sucks). So, all data is stored as
*markdown* inside a sqlite file (which will allow for easy
exporting).
